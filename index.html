            Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
            We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
            We are the people that can find whatever you may need
            If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

        <h2>Understory</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
            If you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay
            And you're a very sexy girl, it's very hard to please
            You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free
            </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
            You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
            If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
            You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me
